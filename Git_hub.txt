What is git - Free and open source version control system.

What is Version Control?

The management of changes to document, computer programs, large web site, and other collections of information

Git Commands

- git init: Initialize project

- git status: see files we working in git

- config git for work
    - git config --global user.email "your_gmail@gmail.com"
    - git config --global user.name "Your_name"

- git clone https://github.com/name_user/name_repository.git : Bring a repository that is hosted (hospedado) somewhere 
like Github into a folder on your local machine

- git add name_file  : Track (camino) your files and changes in Git, after make a commit

- git commit: Save your files in Git 

- git push -u origin name_branch: Upload Git commits to a remote repo, like Github

- git pull https://github.com/name_user/name_repository.git name_branch : Download changes from remote repo to your local machine, 
  the opposite of push

- git log : let see all the commits

Now we goint to learn return back something change

if we want to return back the changes in a file
Note: this we can make if we don't make commit or git add .
- git checkout -- name_file 


- git diff: we can see the difference of change code before and after
    - git diff: see diference all file
    - git diff name_file: see difference only this file
Note: git checkout and git diff we can use before make a git add . and git commit

- .gitignore: this file we put all files for ignore (no add to project git)
here file we write name folder or files to ignore

- git branch: see the branch where we are working
with the branch we can take different version of our code
 
- git branch name_new_branch: create a new branch for work

- git checkout name_new_branch: move to new branch
here we can modify the project of free and all change will save in this branch
if we change of branch to new files disappear (save in other branch)
Note: before of make change of branch, make git commit for avoid error

- upload project github

- git remote add origin https://github/name_user/name_project.git
add the repository for we can upload code

- git push -u origin name_branch 
upload code (remember use as password a token -see setting -> token- )


Use git for project Course_git 

NOTE: this save branch master

git init - initiaze project Course_git

1. We created new files called index.html and Git_hub.txt

we must add this file a git with: 

git add index.html 
git add Git_hub.txt

or use 

git add . 

2. Now we save the changes in git with:

git commit -m "added index" -m "Test git and github" 
this command create a id for each modified file

3. Upload project in github

git push -u origin master

4. We add README.md (this file is repository github) to our project
git pull https://github.com/dervalinor/Course_git.git master

5. we modified index.html but we can return back this change then:

git checkout -- index.html

6. git diff index.html 
See all changes in index.html

7. Our repository we create a new file README.md and we must add to our 
local repository 

git pull https://github.com/dervalinor/Course_git
